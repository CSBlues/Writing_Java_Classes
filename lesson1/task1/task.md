# Point class
### Rewrite the `Point` class

1. Your class should have the following
    - Overloaded constructors:
      - One default constructor (no parameters).
      - Another constructor that takes parameters.
    - `translate` function that moves the point.
    - `distanceToOrigin` function that returns a `double`.
2. Update the `Main.java` file and create a few objects and call some of the methods. Test your code with mutliple objects and print statements to check your work.

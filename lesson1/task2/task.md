# Circle Task
Write the Circle class. 
1. This class has the following `private` fields:
     - `int x`
     - `int y`
     - `double radius` 
 
2. Include at least two constructors to initialize the variables. 
 
3. It has the following instance methods: 
     - `double getArea()`
     - `boolean isInCircle(int a, int b)`
     - `void translate(int dx, int dy)`
     - `void tripleTheRadius()`
     
 Use the `Main.java` class to create and test a few Circle objects.
